## Project Title

**Simulation of Cache Memory Mapping and Replacement Algorithms**

---

## Abstract

Cache memory plays a critical role in improving system performance by reducing memory access time. This project presents a complete simulation of cache memory behavior using different **mapping techniques** and **replacement algorithms**. The implementation helps visualize cache hits, cache misses, and replacement decisions, providing a practical understanding of core **Computer Architecture** concepts through collaborative development using **Git**.
